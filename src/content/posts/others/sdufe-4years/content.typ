Four years ago, I was a freshman in Shandong University of Finance and Economics(SDUFE). Farewell to my hometown, and hello to a new chapter in my life.

At the beginning, I think so.

= Life

SDUFE once satisfied my curiosity about university life, I met some friends, and I got some experiences and precious memories.

I rolled in SDUFE on Sept 2021, and I was a freshman. I was very excited about the university life, and I was looking forward to what I would learn and experience. The first semester was very easy, so I try to join some organizations, likes ACM Club and Class Monitors, etc. Later I join the ACM Club in a match with top ranking of freshman. Unfortunitely, I lost in class monitor competition(in which the monitor is selected by students affairs office), but maybe it is not so bad, since I find that the whole students affairs office was a joke to normal students.

In COVID-19 peroids, SDUFE became a federal which have highly autonomous management. Each

= ACM Club

The most doubtful choice I made was join ACM Club. When I was freshman, I was very interested in competitive programming. Since I was in middle school, I learnt some of OI(Olympiad in Informatics) from Internet, some of my friends also join OI. But I had no change to participate in it, because there was no such organization in my hometown. When I came to SDUFE, I found that there was an ACM Club, so I joined it.

The situation of ACM Club was very hard, there is no lab, no teacher, no sponsor, no money, no resources, no anything. The only thing we had was a few of passionate students who wanted to learn something new and gain medals for ourself.

])

And SDUFE didn't mind marjority competitions at all, ICPC and CCPC are recongnized as third class teamed competition, so every player would gain 0.4 credit for chamption, which is a very low standard, at meanwhile, you can gain 2 credits for thrid-class unoffical competition(we called it 水赛 i.e. competition that does not require ability to get prize).


On the second year, I met some friends who were also interested in competitive programming Myyrh, lmy, Galong. And then I with my teammate Galong and Heyun Sun#footnote[The first abstract persion I met] participated in _The 46th ICPC Asia Shenyang Regional Contest_, just as a beginner. The result was obiviously bad, we only solved 2 problem. (3 problems would be enough for copper)

Later, we found that Sun made a mistake in the contest, which caused us didn't get the correct quest statements. And then, Sun give up to participate competitive programming contests. #footnote[Actually, he didn't have much interest in it. He didn't train at all, which caused he can not complete a simple DFS after match. He just want to takes prize without any effort, unfortunately, he didn't.]

Months later, I participated in ICPC Shandong Provincial Contest with Galong and freshman TrappedGhost, and then gain 41st place. Which break the record of SDUFE in provincal ICPC/CCPC.

When the years came to the time of ICPC online site, I, Galong and TrappedGhost prepared for it a lot, but finally, we forget to sign up on offical website. Which was very funny. 

So my story of competitive programming in SDUFE seems to be end here. So what I get from it? I don't know. I didn't get any prize, but I paid many sweets for it. I don't know whether I should call it a waste of time or not, but I lost my time to imporve myself in practical developing skills for seeking work.Am I regretful? No, I don't think so. I met some friends, and I get some experiences and precious memories. But if I have another chance, I will choose to do something else. No ICPC,no CCPC, no competitive programming, I will do something that I'm interested in.

But no matter how failure on my competitive programming, I met my friends #friend("Galong", url:"https://github.com/gjh303987897") #friend("Myyrh", url: "https://blog.myyrh.com")  #friend("lmy") #friend("1Phan", url: "https://1phan-7878.github.io/") and #friend("TrappedGhost", url:"https://github.com/TrappedGhost") etc. anyway.

= Student Union & Administration Staff(Student Affairs Office)

Everything seems prefect, but student union is not on the list. 

People often say that student union is a partment to serve students. That's wrong. Student union is a partment to serve teachers. Almost all the student union members are students, but they are not students at same time. They are guardians of the teachers, or the teachers' pets. (teachers means the administration staff, not professors and lecturers in study)

The indescribable political movement at the turn of spring and summer

== Double standards

Yes, although I'm not a student union member, I still have some understanding of student union. I don't want to say too much about it, because I don't want to be too negative. I just want to say that I have seen some things that make me feel uncomfortable. 

The member of student union always think they are superior to others, because they have more opportunities to meet with the leaders. They always look for chances to show off their identity, and they always try to find some reason to make themselves feel better. Besides, they have other standards to judge others, which is double standards. The double standards are expressed in 3 aspects:

=== Reimbursement 

=== Credits

=== Awards Application

== Bureaucracy


=== Student Union

Let's talk about the student union first. The student union is characterized by embezzlement of funds, electing freshmen like choosing concubines, and excessive formalism.


=== Administration Staff

Finally there comes _The Stanford Prison_.

Besides, it seems other staff named 王琦 in ecnomics department is far more than against heaven. Luckily I didn't touch with her. See a #hyperlink("zhihu_wangchi.html")[archive] of zhihu question.

= Counterfeit with Guanxi

The funny thing is that, in China, the most important factor is not ability, but guanxi. Additionally, the positions of one's parents matter. Most people will hide their connections to avoid public scrutiny. Through this method, they create a false sense of fairness. And they use sensorship(from government apartments) to suppress public's ability to think.

A student called _/*Congwei*/ \*\* Han_#footnote[Useless self sensorship], whose father is the dean of CS, bought a research paper called _Video Dehazing Network Based on Multiscale Attention_ (#hyperlink("http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3311033")[DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3311033]) and published on IEEE Access to earn MSc recommendation. She once cheat in an exam, and was found by teacher. Then, she was sent to the out of class. But later, she was allow to continue answer sheet after she dialed the dean's phone. The teacher didn't take any action, because she is the dean's daughter. She finally get the MSc recommendation and go to University of Tianjin for further study.

This is not an isolated incident. Sun, #footnote[*Update in Sept 2024*: Sun have published 1 paper in EI as first author, in which direction is different from the topic of his rearch in daily life.]whose mother was a professor at SDU, obtained a robot dog project from SDU and participated in the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition. The robot was familiar to me; I had seen it many times on the internet. Later, during the thesis defense of the robot dog project, he didn't even know what RTO was or what the radar of the robot dog used. Despite this, his team won prizes in many competitions with the dog. #footnote[However, he only got a score of 100 in CSP, where the full score is 500. A freshman in my school got a score of 210 in the same test.]

When you see a cockroach, it proves that the sewer is full of them, _\*\* Hou_ also published a paper named _An Improved Lightweight YOLOv5 for Remote Sensing Images_(#hyperlink("https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-44210-0_7")[DOI:10.1007/978-3-031-44210-0_7])

    Finally, someone has brought up this issue. Taking advantage of the recent topic about Shanhe University, I just want to say a few other things. The leadership of the Computer Science department, most of the teachers, course arrangements, academic resources, postgraduate recommendation rules, and many other bizarre things truly do not match the efforts of many students who want to break out of here. SDUFE has always been in the highest score tier among Shandong provincial belongs universities due to its reputation and employment prospects. The Shandong college entrance examination is also in hell mode, so the learning abilities of those who come here have all survived in cruel competition and are certainly not bad. But after studying for several years, how many can escape Shandong to continue their studies elsewhere or go to higher institutions? How many are forced to return and apply to their own school for postgraduate studies each year? In this environment, how many can still run hard on the path they believe is correct, maintain their innocent and pure mind integrity, and keep their self-discipline? Many people have slowly deteriorated under the influence of their surroundings during this process. The irresponsible college will only hold back those who want to leave here. The truly progressive, hardworking students pursuing their dreams are just victims of some systems in this college and school.

Even the Communist Party members are making counterfeit. So where is the fairness? Just as the auld sentence goes, "When you speak of the law, you speak a joke".

= About this article

This article was written with #hyperlink("https://typst.app/")[Typst] and rendered to SVG. So it have poor responsiveness and can not be indexed by search engine. But I was free to avoid some censor and write something that I want to say.

Why I am using English? Because I am afraid that some people will recognize me and cause trouble to me, and they would not able to find and read this article if I use English with Typst.

= Conclusion

So the story came to an end. I don't want to say that SDUFE is a bad school, because I still have some good memories in it. But I don't want to say that SDUFE is a good school, because I don't think that I get any improvement in my ability from SDUFE. Maybe the responsibility is on me, I didn't try my best to improve myself. But I think that the education department should take some responsibility, because they don't pay attention to the education quality of SDUFE. But I would choose SDUT if I have a change to restart my university life, though it will waste many scores of GaoKao.

#figure(image("117127938_p10.jpg", width: 150pt), caption: "I am already the rubbish")

However, life is no restart and everything goes on. I need to move on and seek my future too.
