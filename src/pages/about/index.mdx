<summary>Me & My Life</summary>

Well, who am I? 

I do not know.

I am just a average guy who is trying to be a better person. 

I have no special talent, but I am always curious about everything. I am trying to be a better me, but sometimes I am lazy.

I am nothing good at, maybe coding? To myself, the term "tech geek" is an unattainable word. It's means I can create something that can be used by everyone, or something that used by no one.

I am searching for my future amidst the chaos and frog of the present. 

And I am get tired of the person with two faces.

I have a dream to be a cat, without worries or sorrows.

I hope to create a miracle that I will never forget in my life.
